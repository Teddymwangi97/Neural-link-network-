Artificial Neural Link Network

This repository contains code and resources for implementing an Artificial Neural Link Network (ANN), a simplified model inspired by neural networks found in nature. ANNs are capable of learning and performing various tasks through interconnected nodes, mimicking the behavior of biological neurons.

Overview:
The ANN consists of interconnected nodes organized in layers. Each node processes input signals and produces output signals based on internal weights and activation functions. Through training, these weights are adjusted to minimize errors, enabling the network to learn and improve its performance over time.

Repository Contents:
Implementation: Contains code for constructing and training the ANN using popular machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch.)
Examples: Demonstrates how to use the ANN for different tasks such as classification, regression, or pattern recognition.
Documentation: Provides detailed documentation on how the ANN works, its architecture, and usage instructions.
Resources: Includes datasets, pretrained models, and any other resources necessary for using and experimenting with the ANN.

Contribution Guidelines:
Contributions to improve the ANLN implementation, add new features, or fix issues are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
Make your changes and ensure that they adhere to the project's coding style and conventions.
Write tests to validate your changes if applicable.
Submit a pull request detailing the changes you've made and why they're necessary.

Feedback and Support:
If you have any questions, suggestions, or issues regarding the ANN or this repository, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.

Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of artificial neural networks with ANN! ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–
